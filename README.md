# Movie Recommender Engine
Movie Recommdner is a a DIY recommender engine for finding movie recommendations and information about current movies. 

You can try the Web-App here: https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//capstone/recommender.php?id=N4yFi2jPx5Xr7l


## Overview:
The goal of the project is to recommend movies based on different criteria which is further based on user ratings of those movies.

_The idea is inspired by a website “twitflicks.com” which used to mine Twitter for
tweets that included comments about current movies. These comments were
then turned into ratings._



## Features:
As a user, you will be able to make recommendations by filtering based on genre, or co-stars, or by
any other criteria. This will help you further curate the recommendations for you
as the program decides which genre you recommended the most, and which
type of movies would suit your taste the best. Further goals include a swingbased GUI and a simple web-app for the said project.


## External Libraries:
The project makes use of 2 external libraries:
  * <a href="https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/javadoc/edu/duke/FileResource.html"> edu.duke.FileResource </a>
